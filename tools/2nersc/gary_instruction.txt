The second account is the user account . These are the credentials you give users to download via globus.

user: ebossguest
pw: !!860ss

The UoP endpoint is :- "University Of Portsmouth ICG Endpoint"

so you enter the ebossguest credentials for the end point.

You can test globus with https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal
