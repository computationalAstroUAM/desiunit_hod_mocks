300 	0.656 

-------------------------------------------------

Outer_Rim simulation characteristics: L=3000 Mpc/h, mp = 1.9E+09 Msol/h; Nsnap=100 (34 between 1<z<3.5); Halo catalogue: 20+ particles (fof halo catalogs with b=0.168 from z=10 to z=0.)

-------------------------------------------------

* Definitions from Katrin Heitmann:

These files are just FOF halos, no substructure information. 

The halo count is the number of particles in a halo, in some sense it is redundant with the halo mass (since you can just take that number and multiply it by the particle mass). 

The halo tag is mostly there to enable identifying halo properties in other files at the same time step. The number is not consistent through the time steps. 

The halo mass is measured in Msun/h. 

The fof_halo_center is measured in comoving Mpc/h and it is the potential minimum. 

The fof_halo_mean is the position of the center of mass. 

Velocities are comoving peculiar in km/s.
