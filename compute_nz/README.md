Compute the histogram of counts if redshift bins of a catalog. It also creates number densities (based on Omefga_matter, and fraction of the sky covered)

usage: ./compute_nz mock out fsky Omm


 mock: input Catalogue. 3rd column expected to be the redshift
 output: name of the file where you want the ouput to be wirtten. See header to know what each column is. 
 fsky: fraction of the sky covered (1=full sky)
 Omm: Omega_Matter
